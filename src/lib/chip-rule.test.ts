// THE CHIP RULE, made structural (a fail-closed grep guard, same shared plumbing as the
// other build-gating tests in this folder).
//
// `components/Chip.tsx` is THE chip. The class `.chip` is its markup, so spelling that class
// by hand anywhere else means a second chip exists — and the second one always drifts on the
// part you cannot see. In the project this was scaffolded from, an audit found 18 hand-rolled
// `.chip` sites; what they had in common was that the primitive could not SAY what they were
// — an action that does something, a chip that navigates, a read-only label — and the
// primitive's own `aria-pressed` was then wrong for the action chips that HAD gone through
// it ("Balayer, toggle button, not pressed" — for ever, on a chip that only fills a field).
//
// Chip carries all the shapes (toggle · action · link · static · expander), so a hand-rolled
// `.chip` is a fork, not a workaround. FAIL-CLOSED: a className holding the bare token
// `chip` may only appear in an ALLOWED entry below, and the entry has to say why the
// primitive cannot host that call site. (Other classes that merely contain the word are not
// matched — only the standalone token. Chip.tsx itself never trips it: it composes its class
// from a local, so there is no `className="chip …"` to find.)

// (className={'chip' + (on ? ' is-on' : '')}), so the scan takes the value — the
// quoted string, or everything inside the braces — and looks at the literals in it.
//
// Scanning EVERY string literal instead (the first shape this took) reads the word
// out of prose and data: a `variant?: 'chip' | 'card'` union, the DevKit's
// search keywords, a demo label with the word "chip" in it. A class rule has to
// look at classes — verified below against a fixture holding both.
