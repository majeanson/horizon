// Row primitives — the two sanctioned ways to lay out a horizontal row of things
// (buttons, chips, controls) so it NEVER bleeds off the right edge on a narrow phone.
// Reach for one of these before hand-rolling a `display:flex` row: a bespoke row with a
// fixed `flex-basis` is the #1 source of x-overflow here (a basis smaller than the
// item's content makes flexbox keep everything on one line and overflow instead of
// wrapping). CSS lives in the `.cluster` / `.rail` families in styles/core.css.
//
//   • <Cluster> — order-independent row that MAY wrap to more lines when it doesn't fit
//     (action bars, chip rows, filter buttons). The default.
//   • <Rail>    — one continuous sequence that must stay on a single line; when it can't
//     fit it SCROLLS sideways instead of wrapping (segmented control, timeline, filmstrip).

// sits past the right edge (no bar to drag, no swipe). Adds no DOM and no layout.

      // gave a mouse a way in; a keyboard had none, because a scroll container that
      // cannot take focus cannot be driven by the arrow keys either — so anything past
      // the right edge was reachable by thumb or wheel only, against this repo's
      // standing desktop-reachability rule. Found by the axe pass in
      // `npm run e2e:matrix` (`scrollable-region-focusable`) on the virements plan
      // card's row of due dates.
      //
      // CONDITIONAL on purpose: a rail becomes a tab stop only while it actually has
      // somewhere to scroll. Making every rail focusable would hand a keyboard user a
      // pile of stops that do nothing — its own accessibility problem — and useHScroll
      // already measures this, so nothing new is computed. Before `{...rest}` so a
      // caller that knows better can still override it.
